# JavaScrip Coding Quiz<br>
Welcome to LucSedirae's JavaScript quiz.<br>
In this application, the user is presented with a set of instructions and a start button.<br>
Once the start button is clicked, the instructions are replaced with a question and a series<br>
of possible answers. Click the corresponding answer button to submit your answer.<br>
A timer starts to count down from 50 once the quiz is started also. A correct answer<br>
will add 15 seconds of quiz time. A wrong answer will deduct 25 seconds. Your score<br>
at the end of the quiz will be equal to the remaining time on your timer. If you run out<br>
of time the quiz will score you based on the number of questions you did answer. If you<br>
receive a negative score, that means you should slow down, read the questions more cafefully<br>
and try again.<br>

Upon a game over scenario (either you ran out of time or finished all the questions) a modal<br>
will pop up alerting you that you have finished the quiz and letting you know your final score.<br>
You can also enter your name here and click submit to store your high scores so you can track<br>
your improvement with each instance of the quiz.<br>
