### Welcome to LucSedirae's JavaScript quiz
<br>
In this application, the user is presented with a set of instructions and a start button.<br>
Once the start button is clicked, the instructions are replaced with a question and a series<br>
of possible answers. Click the corresponding answer button to submit your answer.<br>
<br>
A timer starts to count down from 50 once the quiz is started also. A correct answer<br>
will add 15 seconds of quiz time. A wrong answer will deduct 25 seconds. Your score<br>
at the end of the quiz will be equal to the remaining time on your timer.<br>
<br>
If you run out of time the quiz will score you based on the number of questions you did answer.<br>
If you receive a negative score, that means you should slow down, read the questions more<br>
cafefully and try again.<br>
